# Windows Kris-Kros Game
Kris-Kros game and development kit

## Under construction
_Please, be patient, project is under construction currently._

## About
This project is Kris-Kros based game release and development. Windows only. Development continues on Windows 98 to ensure compatibility with Windows 9x, since this type of OS is still widely used even today and Windows 9x compatible programs have best compatibility across entire Win32 platform, which is also included in Win64 platform. Program you can run on Windows 95 32bit can be run also on Windows 10 64bit.

### What can you expect?
Series of 200 Kris-Kros tables each in two languages (more languages at requests). Part is also the development kit I am building alongside and using it to build the game. Some of the anecdotes made into playable Kris-Kros tables will come with illustrations. Anecdotes are actually taken from various sources of the Internet, their origin is kept in the source and will be displayed in footbar to keep licence. If not, anecdote may be written out of head (does not mean owned, may mean I can't remember source - after all, anecdotes can't be really copyrighted). Many of them include Murphy's laws. More info will be given with further development.

## Downloads
Project will be available for download in appropriate section. Source code and detailed documentation will be provided through Github pages (https://polda18.github.io/Windows-Kris-Kros-Game). Note that this project is Windows only (I don't take responsibility for possible cross-platform forks). Source code is developed and maintained using Visual Studio 6.0 (which is the latest to directly support Windows 98) and copy transfered to Github by external routine outside the virtual machine holding original content. Reason is that Github Desktop does not support older Windows. Gitignore for this project is about to be restructured to exclude Visual Studio 6.0 files in subfolders from repository. This is friendly for creating forks. You can download repository for local fork development, too. Just credit me and link original repository if you do so.

## License
You can view the license by opening the `LICENCE` text file (no extension). You can fork this project to create Unix-friendly version, you'll just need to get rid of all Win32 API references this project is out to have. Also don't forget to keep license intact and credit me.
